#Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project 1
For this peer-graded assignment, I have generated the following files:
1. A txt file named touse.txt, that contains an extract from the [household_power_consumption.txt](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip), which contains data for February 1st and February 2nd, 2007.
2. Four R scripts named: plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R. Each one contains the R code necessary to generate each of the require plots for this assignment.
3. A new folder called plots, that contains the 4 required png files with the 4 required plots.

## How to run the scripts
1. Make sure that your working directory in R contains the file touse.txt
2. Run any of the scripts you are interested in (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R or plot4.R). The script will try to create a directory called plots (if it does not exist already) and will generate the desired plot in your screen device and also copy the plot to a png file of with and height equals 480.
