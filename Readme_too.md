#Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project 1
For this peer-graded assignment, I have generated the following files:

1. A txt file named [touse.txt](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/touse.txt), that contains an extract from the [household_power_consumption.txt](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip), which contains data for February 1st and February 2nd, 2007.
2. Four R scripts named: [plot1.R](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot1.R), [plot2.R](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot2.R), [plot3.R](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot3.R) and [plot4.R](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot4.R). Each one contains the R code necessary to generate each of the require plots for this assignment.
3. A new folder called [plots](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/tree/master/plots), that contains the 4 required png files with the 4 required plots.
4. A Readme_too.md: this file.

## How to run the scripts
1. Make sure that your working directory in R contains the file touse.txt
2. Run any of the scripts you are interested in ([plot1.R](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot1.R), [plot2.R](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot2.R), [plot3.R](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot3.R) and [plot4.R](https://github.com/pachy78/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/plot4.R)). The script will try to create a directory called plots (if it does not exist already) and will generate the desired plot as a png file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
